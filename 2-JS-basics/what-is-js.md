# What is JavaScript?

- JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform (not just web dev), object-oriented programming language

- JavaScript is 1/3 of the core technologies of web development (HTML/CSS/JS)

- Can be used in frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side)

## Visualizing the Foundations of Web Dev

Comparing web dev to sentence structure

HTML: think "nouns" - <p></p> - paragraph
CSS: think "adjectives" - p {color: red;} - the paragraph text is red
JS: think "verb" - p.hide(); - hide the paragraph (bad example, because CSS can do this too)

## Primitive JavaScript data types

1. Number - floating point numbers including both decimals & integers
2. String - text characters
3. Boolean - true / false
4. Undefined - Data type of a variable that does not have a value yet (unassigned?)
5. Null - Non-existent

Note: JS has "dynamic typing" which means data types are automatically assigned to variables
